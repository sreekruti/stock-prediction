To begin the Stock Market Comparison Analysis, I will first gather the stock price data for Apple and Google for the past quarter. 
For this purpose, I will utilize the Yahoo Finance API. To install the API, you can execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
Code-

pip install yfinance

Step 1 : Import the necessary Python libraries to get started with the task:

import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.graph_objects as go
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"

Step 2: Retrieval of historical stock price data and Defining the Date Ranges 

The following code establishes the analysis by specifying the companies and date range of interest, followed by retrieving the historical stock price data 
for Apple and Google during that period.
This data will serve as the foundation for various financial evaluations and comparisons, such as computing returns, volatility, 
and other metrics to assess the performance and risk associated with these stocks.

# Define the tickers for Apple and Google
apple_ticker = 'AAPL'
google_ticker = 'GOOGL'

# Define starting and ending dates
start_date = pd.to_datetime('2023-01-01')
end_date = pd.to_datetime('2024-03-31')

HERE I AM CALCULAR=TING THE STOCKS FROM JAN 2023 TILL MARCH 2024
WE CAN CHANGE THE START AND END DATE RANGES

Step 3: Calculate the daily returns of Apple and Google in the stock market

# Loop through each quarter
for quarter in pd.date_range(start_date, end_date, freq='QS'):
  # Define quarter specific dates
  quarter_start = quarter
  quarter_end = quarter + pd.DateOffset(months=2, days=31)  # Adjust for max days in a month

  # Fetch historical stock price data using yfinance
  apple_data = yf.download(apple_ticker, start=quarter_start, end=quarter_end)
  google_data = yf.download(google_ticker, start=quarter_start, end=quarter_end)

  # Calculate daily returns
  apple_data['Daily_Return'] = apple_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()
  google_data['Daily_Return'] = google_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

Step 4: Create figures for Daily Returns, Cumulative Returns, and Volatility

# Daily Returns
  fig = go.Figure()
  fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=apple_data.index, y=apple_data['Daily_Return'],
                          mode='lines', name='Apple', line=dict(color='blue')))
  fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=google_data.index, y=google_data['Daily_Return'],
                          mode='lines', name='Google', line=dict(color='green')))

  fig.update_layout(title=f'Daily Returns for Apple and Google ({quarter_start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")} - {quarter_end.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")})',
                    xaxis_title='Date', yaxis_title='Daily Return',
                    legend=dict(x=0.02, y=0.95))
  # Display the figure 
  fig.show() 
  
# Cumulative Returns
  fig = go.Figure()
  fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=apple_data.index, y=(apple_data['Adj Close'] / apple_data['Adj Close'].iloc[0]) - 1,
                          mode='lines', name='Apple (Cumulative)', line=dict(color='blue')))
  fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=google_data.index, y=(google_data['Adj Close'] / google_data['Adj Close'].iloc[0]) - 1,
                          mode='lines', name='Google (Cumulative)', line=dict(color='green')))

  fig.update_layout(title=f'Cumulative Returns for Apple and Google ({quarter_start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")} - {quarter_end.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")})',
                    xaxis_title='Date', yaxis_title='Cumulative Return (%',
                    legend=dict(x=0.02, y=0.95))
  fig.show()  

In this analysis, we initially computed the cumulative returns for Apple and Google for the previous quarter. 
Cumulative returns indicate the overall percentage change in a stock's value over a specific period, factoring in the compounding impact of daily returns. 
Subsequently, we contrasted the investment performance of Apple and Google during the designated timeframe, highlighting which stock exhibited superior or inferior cumulative returns. 
It is evident in my date range that Google outperformed Apple in terms of cumulative returns for the last quarter.

  # Volatility
  fig1 = go.Figure()
  fig1.add_bar(x=['Apple', 'Google'], y=[apple_data['Daily_Return'].std(), google_data['Daily_Return'].std()],
                text=[f'{apple_data["Daily_Return"].std():.4f}', f'{google_data["Daily_Return"].std():.4f}'],
                textposition='auto', marker=dict(color=['blue', 'green']))
  fig1.update_layout(title=f'Volatility Comparison ({quarter_start.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")} - {quarter_end.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")})',
                    xaxis_title='Stock', yaxis_title='Volatility (Standard Deviation)',
                    bargap=0.5)
  fig1.show()  

We first calculated the historical volatility for both Apple and Google stocks. 
Volatility is a measure of how much the stock’s price fluctuates over time. In this case, we are calculating the standard deviation of daily returns to measure the volatility. 
Then we visualized the calculated volatility to assess and compare the volatility or risk associated with both Apple and Google stocks during the specified period. 
I see that Google’s volatility is higher than Apple’s for my data

It indicates that Google’s stock price experienced larger price fluctuations or greater price variability over the last quarter. 

Here’s what this difference in volatility may indicate:
1. Google’s stock is considered riskier compared to Apple: Investors generally associate higher volatility with higher risk because it implies that the stock price can change significantly in a short period.

2. Google’s stock may be more sensitive to market conditions, economic factors, or company-specific news and events: This heightened sensitivity can result in larger price swings.

3. Traders and investors with a higher risk tolerance might find Google’s stock appealing if they are looking for opportunities to profit from short-term price movements.

Step 5: Compare the stock market of Google and Apple according to the stock market benchmark
# Market Benchmark
  market_data = yf.download('^GSPC', start=quarter_start, end=quarter_end)

  # Calculate daily returns for all
  apple_data['Daily_Return'] = apple_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()
  google_data['Daily_Return'] = google_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()
  market_data['Daily_Return'] = market_data['Adj Close'].pct_change()

  # Calculate Beta for Apple and Google
  cov_apple = apple_data['Daily_Return'].cov(market_data['Daily_Return'])
  var_market = market_data['Daily_Return'].var()
  beta_apple = cov_apple / var_market

  cov_google = google_data['Daily_Return'].cov(market_data['Daily_Return'])
  beta_google = cov_google / var_market

  # Print Beta for this quarter
  print(f"Beta for Apple ({quarter_start.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} - {quarter_end.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}):", beta_apple)
  print(f"Beta for Google ({quarter_start.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')} - {quarter_end.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}):", beta_google)
  print("-" * 20)  # Optional separator for clarity
In the provided code, we analyze the relative sensitivity of Apple and Google stocks to overall market fluctuations, offering insights into their comparative volatility and risk concerning the broader U.S. stock market represented by the S&P 500 index.

The S&P 500, commonly known as the S&P 500, stands as a highly regarded stock market benchmark in the United States. Comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the nation, 
selected based on market capitalization, liquidity, and industry diversity, this index spans various sectors of the U.S. economy, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the stock market's performance and well-being.

In the aforementioned results, the beta coefficient for Apple stands at approximately 0.9187. This value indicates that Apple's stock is estimated to be 8.96% more volatile or reactive to market movements, as indicated by the S&P 500 index, compared to the overall market.
For Google, the beta coefficient approximates 1.3081. This suggests that Google's stock is estimated to be around 30.8% more volatile or sensitive to market shifts.

A beta exceeding 1 implies that a stock tends to exhibit greater volatility than the market. 
In this instance, only Google demonstrate beta coefficients surpassing 1, signifying it's expected higher volatility and susceptibility to market movements. 
Google's notably higher beta value compared to Apple's suggests that Google's stock is estimated to bear a greater degree of market sensitivity or risk than Apple's. 
Investors should factor in this information when making investment decisions, recognizing that higher-beta stocks may offer increased potential returns but also entail elevated risk levels.
